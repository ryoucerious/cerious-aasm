## Running Modes

### Desktop Mode (Default)
Standard Electron application with full GUI interface.

### Headless Mode
Run the application without GUI, providing web-based access.

#### Development Mode (npm scripts)
```bash
# Run without authentication
npm run headless

# Run with custom port
npm run headless -- --port=8080

# Run with default authentication (username: admin, password: admin123)
npm run headless:auth

# Run with custom credentials
npm run headless:auth:custom
```

#### Production Mode (Installed Package)
When using the installed `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage package on Linux:

```bash
# Basic headless mode
cerious-aasm --no-sandbox --headless

# With custom port
cerious-aasm --no-sandbox --headless --port=8080

# With authentication (default username: admin)
cerious-aasm --no-sandbox --headless --auth-enabled --password=admin123 --port=3000

# With custom credentials
cerious-aasm --no-sandbox --headless --auth-enabled --username=myuser --password=mypassword

# Full example with all options
cerious-aasm --no-sandbox --headless --port=5000 --auth-enabled --username=admin --password=secret123
```

**Note for Linux users:** The `--no-sandbox` flag is required when running in headless mode on Linux due to Chrome sandbox restrictions. This flag is only needed for headless mode, not for the GUI version.

#### Command Line Parameters
- `--port=<port>` - Set web server port (default: 3000)
- `--auth-enabled` - Enable authentication for web interface
- `--username=<username>` - Set authentication username (default: admin)
- `--password=<password>` - Set authentication password (required with --auth-enabled)
- `--help` or `-h` - Show help message

#### Examples
```bash
# Development: Headless on port 8080 without authentication
npm run headless -- --port=8080

# Production: Headless with authentication on default port
cerious-aasm --no-sandbox --headless --auth-enabled --username=admin --password=secret123

# Production: Headless with authentication on custom port
